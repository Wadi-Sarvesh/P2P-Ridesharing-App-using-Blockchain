A ridesharing service providing app like Uber but decentralized!
Blockchain based android app connecting drivers and users
Users can request for a shared ride with others hassle free though the app
Most of the existing ride sharing applications like Uber, Ola
deploy centralized 3rd party based systems to provide ride
sharing services to customers.

The problem with these traditional ride sharing systems is the centralization of data
which could at times lead to failure of the whole system if
server failure is encountered. Moreover, Centralized systems
have a single point of corruption, single point of failure and
are fragile in nature when compared with decentralized
systems.

Existing ride-sharing services, while functional and popular, can be improved in proper pricing models, increased security, transaction transparency, and data security. Riders may communicate directly with drivers via the blockchain's decentralized network, minimizing the need for extra fees. 
People with a smartphone and safe contemporary automobiles have greater market opportunities since there are no intermediaries. The system proposed in this paper has tried to accomplish all of these.
The resulting android application handles user ride sharing requests and pairs them with other drivers in the vicinity. Users can get paired with their peers through the matchmaking that the application provides which is deployed over a blockchain.App deployed  is very user friendly; users can book rides easily, securely and as quickly as possible.
