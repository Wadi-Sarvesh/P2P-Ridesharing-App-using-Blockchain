A ridesharing service providing app like Uber but decentralized!
Blockchain based android app connecting drivers and users
Users can request for a shared ride with others hassle free though the app
Most of the existing ride sharing applications like Uber, Ola
deploy centralized 3rd party based systems to provide ride
sharing services to customers. The problem with these
traditional ride sharing systems is the centralization of data
which could at times lead to failure of the whole system if
server failure is encountered. Moreover, Centralized systems
have a single point of corruption, single point of failure and
are fragile in nature when compared with decentralized
systems.
